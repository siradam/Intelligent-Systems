# Intelligent-Systems
Mini Project of the course Intelligent Systems which helps to build foundation of Data Processing such as Pre-Processing and Features Selection and basic Machine Learning methods such as Prediction Model
## Data:
3 time-series data of rivers water level which including time, temperature, water level, raining, stutus and a time-series data of main station.
## Content:
  - Pre-processing Data: Missing Values,Outliers, Scaling, Data Encoding, Data Visuallization.
  - Conducting PCA for Water Level: choices for the dimensionality reduction.
  - Inconsistency Rate: Calculating IR and use this for feature selection.
  - Prediction Model: Using the provided tools from Sckit Learn to select and train a model then predict the water level.
